# 🔗 403-Killchain

### The Ultimate 403 Forbidden Bypass Framework

**403‑Killchain** fuses four independent bypass engines into a single, silent binary.  
Each engine uses a unique strategy to turn `403 Forbidden` into `200 OK`.  
They run **in parallel**, and the results are merged into one clear, actionable report.  
No more running multiple tools, no more missed tricks. One command, one killchain.

## 💡 How 403‑Killchain Works

The tool embeds four distinct engines, each attacking the same URL with its own set of techniques:

### Engine 1 – Path & Header Fuzzer
This engine systematically mutates the URL path and injects common bypass headers.
- Appends slashes, encoded characters, and path traversal sequences (`/`, `%2e`, `;`, `..;/`)
- Adds headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Originating-IP`, `X-Rewrite-URL`, `X-Real-IP`
- Switches HTTP methods on the fly (GET → POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Sends every combination quickly and reports any response that isn’t a 403

### Engine 2 – Header & Method Mutator
This engine takes a more protocol‑oriented approach, manipulating the request line and headers to confuse access controls.
- Inserts malformed request lines (HTTP/1.0 downgrades, extra spaces, double slashes)
- Tries alternative host headers, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `Origin` overrides
- Exploits discrepancies between front‑end proxies and back‑end servers
- Uses payloads designed to bypass WAFs and reverse proxies

### Engine 3 – Status‑Code Reasoner
This engine brute‑forces the common patterns that web servers use to enforce 403 rules.
- Tests every known HTTP method with different Content‑Types
- Sends the same request multiple times with small changes (case‑flipping, Unicode tricks)
- Learns from `nmap`‑style path lists and common admin panels
- Flags any response that silently returns 200, 301, or 302

### Engine 4 – Encoding & Randomisation
This engine uses entropy to avoid pattern‑based blocking.
- URL‑encodes, double‑encodes, and Unicode‑encodes every path segment
- Generates random parameter names and values to evade signature‑based filters
- Sends requests at slightly varied speeds (jitter) to stop rate‑limiting
- Combines multiple bypass techniques into single, high‑entropy requests

All four engines run **concurrently** – you get the full collective output in less time than it takes to run two of them separately.
